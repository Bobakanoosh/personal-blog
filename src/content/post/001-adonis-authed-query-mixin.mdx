For anyone unfamiliar, AdonisJS v6 is a TypeScript-first Node.js web framework, similar to the likes of Laravel and Ruby on Rails. If you're comfortable with a MVC pattern, you'll be right at home with AdonisJS.

## Fetching Models of Authenticated User

While working on a personal financial tracking app, I realized that querying a Model based on the currently authenticated user would be a common workflow since I won't be sharing data across users.

I landed on the below, very clean solution:
```ts
export default class TransactionsController {
  async index({ response }: HttpContext) {
    const transaction = await Transaction.authedQuery()
    // ...
  }
}
```

That's it!

## How I got there

Let's take a step back and look where I started, and how my code evolved to this solution.

### The Basic Way
```ts
export default class TransactionsController {
    async index({ response, auth }: HttpContext) {
        const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
        const transactions = await Transaction.query().where('userId', user.id)
        // ..
    }
}
```

There's nothing wrong with this approach, but it's not very reusable. Now anytime I query a model across the entire app, I'll have to repeat most of that code.

### Using withScopes

Now that I know what code I want to reduce, my first goal is to get it working for *just this model*. 
We can worry about a more generic solution for all Models later.

After looking at the Lucid docs, I found [withScopes](https://lucid.adonisjs.com/docs/model-query-builder#withscopes). 
This essentially lets us create a static property on the model, that has access to the `query` object, and, we can pass custom parameters: the authenticated User! Exactly what we need.

Here's what it looks like:
```ts
export default class Transaction extends BaseModel {
  // Admittedly this name could be better
  static belongsToUser = scope((query, user: User) => {
    query.where('userId', user.id)
  })
}
```
Now we can do:
```ts
export default class TransactionsController {
  async index({ response, auth }: HttpContext) {
    const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
    const transactions = await Transaction.query()
        .withScopes((scopes) => {
            scopes.belongsToUser(user)
        })
    // ..
  }
}
```
This reduces the total lines of code we'll have, but still is pretty verbose.

Let's first take a stab at making this reusable across all Models.

### Using TypeScript Mixins

One option is to create an `AppModel` class that extends `BaseModel`, and has the static `belongsToUser` variable on it:
```ts
export default class AppModel extends BaseModel {
  static belongsToUser = scope((query, user: User) => {
    query.where('userId', user.id)
  })
}

// app/models/Transaction.ts
export default class Transaction extends AppModel {
  // ...
}
```
This works fine and isn't a half-bad solution. However, I'd prefer to follow AdonisJS's usage of TypeScript Mixins.


### What is a Mixin?

[Mixins](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/mixins.html) are a TypeScript feature for extending the functionality of a class.

AdonisJS uses them in a few ways, one example being in their Official [@adonisjs/auth](https://github.com/adonisjs/auth) package:

`withAuthFinder` adds a few helper methods to add user lookup and password verification methods on a model.
```ts
// app/models/user.ts
import { compose } from '@adonisjs/core/helpers'
import { BaseModel } from '@adonisjs/lucid/orm'
import { withAuthFinder } from '@adonisjs/auth/mixins/lucid'

const AuthFinder = withAuthFinder(() => hash.use('scrypt'), {
  uids: ['email'],
  passwordColumnName: 'password',
})

export default class User extends compose(BaseModel, AuthFinder) {
   // ...
}
```

Using the [compose](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/references/helpers#compose) helper, we can have `User` extend both `BaseModel` and `AuthFinder`.


### Let's make our own Mixin
```ts
// app/mixins/with_belongs_to_user_mixin.ts
export function withBelongsToUser() {
  return <Model extends NormalizeConstructor<typeof BaseModel>>(superclass: Model) => {
    class ModelWithBelongsToUser extends superclass {
      static belongsToUser = scope((query, user: User) => {
        query.where('userId', user.id)
      })
    }

    return ModelWithBelongsToUser
  }
}
```

Which we can then use like so:
```ts
// app/models/transaction.ts
import { withBelongsToUser } from 'app/mixins/with_belongs_to_user_mixin'

export default class Transaction extends compose(BaseModel, withBelongsToUser()) {
  // ...
}
```

Now any model can easily use the `belongsToUser` scope!

### Making it shorter
Remember the end goal is to be able to do `Transaction.authedQuery()`.

So, let's start by making a static method within the mixin:
```ts
static authedQuery() {
  // ...
}
```

Now, we need to figure out how to get:
1. The `query` object
2. The current authenticated `User`

The query is easy, after all, we're in a class extending `BaseModel`, so we can just use `this.query()`:
```ts
static authedQuery() {
  const query = this.query()
}
```

Then, we can use the scope we previously added to the mixin:
```ts
static authedQuery() {
  const query = this.query()
  return query.withScopes(() => this.belongsToUser(query, /* user goes here */))
}
```

I guess we'll have to suffer with passing the `User` object as a parameter for now:
```ts
static authedQuery(user: User) {
  const query = this.query()
  return query.withScopes(() => this.belongsToUser(query, user))
}
```

So now, we can do:
```ts
// app/models/transaction.ts
import { withBelongsToUser } from 'app/mixins/with_belongs_to_user_mixin'

export default class Transaction extends compose(BaseModel, withBelongsToUser()) {
  async index({ auth }: HttpContext) {
    const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
    const transactions = await Transaction.authedQuery(user)
    // ...
  }
}
```

Huzzah! *almost* there. One could argue this is good enough, but that one line will haunt my dreams if I don't get rid of it.


### Accessing HttpContext anywhere
I remembered reading in the docs about a way to get the current `HttpContext` from anywhere in the app, via [Async local storage](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/concepts/async-local-storage#async-local-storage).
There's pros and cons to enabling this, so if you'd rather not, feel free to skip this section.

From the docs:
> [Async Local Storage] allows storing data throughout the lifetime of a web request or any other asynchronous duration. It is similar to thread-local storage in other languages

Enabling it is easy:
```ts
// config/app.ts
export const http = defineConfig({
  useAsyncLocalStorage: true,
})
```

and now, ["anywhere"](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/concepts/async-local-storage#caveats) in the app, we can do:
```ts
const ctx = HttpContext.getOrFail()
```

### Combining it all

Taking everything we've learned so far and putting it together, we can create a mixin that adds an `authedQuery` method to any model:
```ts
// app/mixins/with_authed_query_mixin.ts
export function withAuthedQuery() {
  return <Model extends NormalizeConstructor<typeof BaseModel>>(superclass: Model) => {
    class ModelWithAuthedQuery extends superclass {
      static belongsToUser = scope((query, user: User) => {
        query.where('userId', user.id)
      })

      static authedQuery() {
        const { auth } = HttpContext.getOrFail()
        const user = auth.getUserOrFail()
        const query = this.query()
        return query.withScopes(() => this.belongsToUser(query, user))
      }
    }

    return ModelWithAuthedQuery
  }
}
```

and use it like so ðŸŽ‰:
```ts
// app/models/transaction.ts
import { withAuthedQuery } from 'app/mixins/with_authed_query_mixin'

export default class Transaction extends compose(BaseModel, withAuthedQuery()) {
  async index({ response }: HttpContext) {
    const transactions = await Transaction.authedQuery()
    // ...
  }
}
```
